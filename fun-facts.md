## Fun Facts

Here, here's some rapid fire fun facts about me:
1. I am half blind (_my left eye is fine but my right eye is blind_).
2. I used to take choir and I currently study sound design.
3. Double Major in College with majors in **Information Technology** and **Technical Theatre**.
4. Proud owner of a Steam Deck.
5. Took piano for a few years, but would honestly rather pick up the accordion if I ever tried an instrument again.
6. I've had 4 dogs over the years.
