## Why the name TurnipDaNoyz?

Theres two reasons behind my name:

1. Because it relates to Sound Design, a hobby I ultimately want to pick up someday and-
2. Because its what I made my Xbox gamertag on Christmas. Lol.

It's stuck around ever since. I'm quite happy with it, and I think it's pretty funny.

Another alias I went by back then was ``Squeezy_Orange``, on _Minecraft_. Ultimately I got tired of it and wanted something else.
Other than that, theres not much else to my name. The pun should be obvious, but I still get a chuckle everytime I hear someone say:
> "Oh, so _Turn up the Noise_ is the joke behind your name."

Pretty happy with it. :D
